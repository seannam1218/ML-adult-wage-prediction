# ML-adult-wage-prediction

This is a data science project by Sean Nam and June Shim for CMPT 353: Computational Data Science (Summer 2019) course from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.
This specific project has been copied over from the original project at SFU repository, then edited for better presentation.
In this project, we applied machine learning techniques with several python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn in order to predict adults with wages greater than $50k.
