# ML-adult-wage-prediction

This is a data science project that aims to predict adult wage by Sean Nam and June Shim as a group project for CMPT 353: Computational Data Science (Summer 2019) from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.
This specific repository has been copied over from the original project at SFU repository, then edited for better presentation.
In this project, we applied machine learning techniques with several python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn in order to predict adults with wages greater than $50k.
