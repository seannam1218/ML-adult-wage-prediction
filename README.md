# ML-adult-wage-prediction

This is a data science project by Sean Nam and June Shim for CMPT 353: Computational Data Science (Summer 2019) course from Simon Fraser University. This specific project has been copied over from the original project at SFU repository, then edited for better presentation.
In this project, we applied machine learning techniques using several python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to build a model which predicts whether an adult would have a salary greater than $50k.
