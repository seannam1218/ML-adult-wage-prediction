# ML-adult-wage-prediction

This is a data science project by Sean Nam and June Shim for CMPT 353: Computational Data Science (Summer 2019) course from Simon Fraser University. This particular version has been copied over from the original project from the SFU repository, then edited for better presentation.
We are working with a popular machine learning (ML) dataset called the adult wage dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) which is often used by researchers to evaluate k-Nearest Neighbours ML models. We are given the following features for each person: age, work class, weight of sample, education, number of years in education, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, work hours, and native country. 
We applied machine learning techniques using several python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to build a model which predicts whether an adult would have a salary greater than $50k.
The purpose of the project was to build and compare different models to determine the model with the highest validation score possible (without overfitting), and to explore different techniques that can improve these models.
